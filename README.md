# Coding_everyday
Coding_everyday is a project that Alex and I am doing.
We want to be better/learn how to code, and therefore we are going to code a minimum of 30 minutes everyday.
We then needed a place to share our projects with eachother, so we could see eachothers answer to a problem and comment on them.
